Usage

  It is important that whenever you begin, that you pull the up to date repository, simply pressing pull and OK will do

  Due to project requirements we have to make branches to divide our work, beginning each sprint create a branch with your name and the sprint number (ex. cpillarssprint2), simply click the branch button and enter the branch name

  After cloned, the project can be opened in an IDE to be edited, when an edit is made (anything from adding a file/folder to adding code) it will display in Sourcetree if "File Status > Working Copy" is selected
  Move unstaged files to staged files by using "stage all" or "stage selected"

  Write a commit message when you have a set of changes you are happy with, the commit message should describe in moderate detail what is in the commit (ex. added Sourcetree documentation)
  Usually you wouldn't want everything you've done for a whole sprint in one commit, a commit should be small such as a piece of documentation, or a specific function (just a general rule)
  Press commit, this updates your local repository

  After commits are made, push will update the Github repository, so we may share our changes
