Usefull git commands

git status - Shows the changes that have been made to your files and whether they are ready for commit or not. (green- ready), (red - not ready)
			and if your branch is up to date with the branch you are tracking OR whether it's ahead in commit to the branch you are tracking.

git add "file name" - adds the file to the "ready to be commited"/green column.
	Example: git add /pages/login.php

git commit -m "message" - commit the files which then are ready to be pushed
	Example: git commit -m "Fixed a login bug"

git push - pushes your changes to the remote branch
	Example: git push
		git push origin "branch" - pushes the changes to that specific branch in the remote repo
			example: git push origin gheqimi - pushes the changes to branch gheqimi in the remote repo
		
git pull - pulls from the branch that you have it set to (see below how to set your branch to pull from a certain remote repo
	Example: git pull
		git pull origin "branch" - pulls from the remote repo branch specified
			example: git pull origin bootstraptest - pull from the remote repo branch bootstraptest


Set Up git so the command 'git pull' automatically pulls from the remote repo bootstraptest.

git branch --set-upstream-to origin/"branch1" "branch2" - sets branch 2 to track from branch1 and 'git pull' pulls from branch1 
	Example: git branch --set-upstream-to origin/bootstraptest gheqimi - sets gheqimi branch to track the remote branch bootstraptest and pull from it
